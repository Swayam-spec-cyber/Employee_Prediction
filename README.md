# Employee_Prediction
Predict whether an employee earns greater than $50K or less/equal to $50K annually using a machine learning classifier on the Adult Income Dataset.

📄 Project Overview
This project builds a classification system that predicts the income category (<=50K or >50K) of an employee based on various demographic and occupational features. The workflow covers data analysis, preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, evaluation, and example predictions.

📁 Dataset
Source: UCI Adult Dataset or similar CSV-format employee salary dataset.

Sample features: age, education, occupation, hours-per-week, experience, income (target).

🛠️ Requirements
Python (>=3.7)

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

joblib (optional, for model saving)

Install dependencies:

bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib
🚀 How to Run
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-salary-prediction.git
cd employee-salary-prediction
Place the dataset:
Download the data (adult.csv) and place it in your working directory.

Open and Run the Notebook:
Open Employee_Salary_Prediction.ipynb (or your notebook) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

bash
jupyter notebook Employee_Salary_Prediction.ipynb
Run all cells to complete data loading, cleaning, analysis, model training, and evaluation.

📒 Notebook Workflow
The step-by-step notebook covers:

Importing libraries

Data loading and inspection

Data cleaning and handling missing values

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Categorical and numeric feature analysis

Correlation heatmaps

Feature Encoding

Model training (Random Forest Classifier)

Evaluation (Accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix)

Example prediction

📊 Results
Random Forest achieves strong predictive accuracy for salary classification.

The notebook includes all code for model interpretation and feature importance analysis.
